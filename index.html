              <h2> Introduction</h2>
            </div>
              <h3> Abstract</h3>
              <p>Brexit was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The United Kingdom is the first and so far the only member state to have left the EU, after 47 years of having been a part of the union. It is an event that has made people very vocal and different opinions have been shared, particularly in the media. In this project, we want to put this event under the microscope and investigate several aspects of it. First, we want to do a descriptive analysis: When did we start mentioning Brexit, which words are used the most in our database, which are the main authors of the quotes, which media have relayed the information the most, etc.</p>
              <h3> Datasets</h3>
              We applied our data analysis on the following three datasets
              <ul>
           <li><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4277311#.Ybr8Bywo9QI">Quotebank</a></li>
           <p> Quotebank is a dataset of 178 million unique, speaker-attributed quotations that were extracted from 196 million English news articles crawled from over 377 thousand web domains between August 2008 and April 2020. Our analysis only focus on Brexit related quotations, we only used datasets from 2015 to 2020 in Quotebank.
           To filter quotations related to Brexit, we firstly filter any quoation contains both "EU" and "UK" (combinations of full names and abbreviations) or any quotation contains "Brexit". Then we filtered previous selected quotations for a second round, we only keeped previous selected quotations which contain any key word in
           ['brexit','leave campaign and remain campaign','no deal', 'transition period', 'leave', 'withdral', 'referendum', 'split from']. </p>
           <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VAFHacZFh0oxSxilgNByb1nlNsqznUf0">Speaker Attributes</a></li>
           Speaker attributes dataset is provided by ADA teaching team which which extract some information about speakers such as nationality, occupation, party etc. from the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata knowledge</a> base.
           <li><a href="https://icannwiki.org/Country_code_top-level_domain">Country code top-level domain(ccTLD)</a></li>
           To extract the country of the domain for further analysis, we appiled beatutiful soup to extract the infomation we needed in Country code top-level domain(ccTLD) page.
          <li><a href="https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/blob/master/all/all.csv">
          ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes</a></li>
          For map plotting, we need the ISO-3166 alpha‑3 codes for all countries. So we extract part of csv from the ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/all.csv file.
          
          </ul>
          
           <h3> Methods</h3>
           <ul>
              <li>Data Collection</li>
              <p>To merge quotebank with the additional datasets, we have filtered those quotations related to Brexit by identifying possible keywords related to Brexit as stated in Datasets section.
                We have already combined quotations with speaker attributes by joining with QIDs. We also scrapped the web page to get the domain countries using beautiful soup for future analysis. </p>
              <li>Sentiment Analysis</li>
              We then carried out a sentiment analysis, for that we used the results of three packages: Textblob, SentimentIntensityAnalyze and Flair. We have then taken the median of the three resulting polarities.
              To subsequently decide on the thresholds to choose for classifying the emotions (Positive, Negative, or Neutral), we manually labeled 100 quotes and selected the thresholds accordingly. It is critical to note that the resulting emotion does not reflect the direct view or perception of the Brexit, i.e. pro or con.
              The resulting emotion is based on the tone of the quote. As an example (fabricated), the two quotes: "Brexit is crucial, staying in the union would be a catastrophe, a suicide" and "Staying in the union is crucial, leaving would be a catastrophe, a suicide" will both be assigned a negative emotion by design even though they stand for two different opinions.
              <li>LDA Topic Modeling </li>
              To extract the country of the domain for further analysis, we appiled beatutiful soup to extract the infomation we needed in Country code top-level domain(ccTLD) page.
              <li>Spectral Clustering </li>
              pectral clustering was applied for speakers and for different subclasses of occupation over time.
              We first encoded the category features-nationality, polarity, and occupation-using two methods: hot encoding and target encoding. We then used the T-SNE method to compress the features and generate tsne_x,tesn_y so that they could be plotted in 2D or 3D graphs. We obtained some plots and results, but we will leave the final interpretation and more advanced implementation of the T-SNE approach to be done as a future improvement of our T-SNE method.
              You can find the first results, uncommented, of the cluster analysis at the end of this notebook

                  <h2> I. Media's Coverage</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The original Quotebanks dataset contains 115,584,257 records. As described in the DataPreProcessing notebook, we initially extracted quotes that were solely about Brexit, the United Kingdom and/or the European Union. We then proceeded with filtering these records to consider only those containing one of the words from the following list: leave campaign and remain campaign, no deal, transition period, leave, withdral, referendum and split from as Brexit-related quotes.
      
      As a result, we ended up with 101,878 Brexit-related citations for more in-depth analysis.</p>
      
                  <!-- ======= Section I-2 ======= -->
                  <h2> When did the media start to mention Brexit?</h2>
      
                  <div class="pngplot"><img src="plots/1_2.png" /></div>
                    Always considering the filtered Quotebank data, the graph above represents the number of citations related to the Brexit over the years. We first notice that before 2015, only a few hundred citations were related to Brexit. This switches in 2016 - the year when the Brexit was voted- and we can see that until 2019, the number of citations will keep increasing until waiting for its peak. Yet in 2020, we witness a sharp drop. We suggest that this is because most news stories were relaying information about the coronavirus at that time. Another theory would be that the data was not completely extracted from year 2020.
      
      In order to further analyze this trend over the years, we look at what happens each year while looking at the dates that marked the Brexit.

                  </div>
                  <ul>
                    <li> June 23, 2016 - The UK votes to leave in a referendum. The "Leave" camp, which favors the UK's exit from the EU, won with 51.9%, compared to 48.1% for the pro-EU "Remain" camp.
                    <li> July 13, 2016 - Theresa May becomes Prime Minister following the resignation of David Cameroon.
                    <li> March 29, 2017 - Warning: two-year countdown to the UK's exit from the European Union. The UK is then negotiating an exit agreement.
                    <li> December 8, 2017 - Birth of the backstop: tensions form on Irish borders. In the event of an exit without an agreement of the United Kingdom from the EU, the 500 kilometers that separate the British province of Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland could become a physical border again. As London has decided to leave the single market and the customs union, which are synonymous with freedom of movement and common standards and customs duties, border controls will be necessary. However, this return to a border between the two countries would weaken the Good Friday Peace Agreement, which ended, in 1998, thirty years of armed conflict between nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland.
                    <li> November 25, 2018- After a period of calm, the subject of the Backstop resurfaces a second time.
                    <li> June 24, 2019 - May takes a bow: Theresa May submits her resignation, following her failure to pass her plan to withdraw from the European Union.
                    <li> July 24, 2019- the Johnson era begins: Boris Johnson is elected leader of the Conservative Party the following year, he succeeds Theresa May as Prime Minister, promising a rapid exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
                    <li> 28 August 2019- Parliament put on ice for 5 weeks: In August, reports emerged that the new PM had asked the Queen to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to 31 October.
                    <li> 2 October 2019 - Johnson sets out his ‘reasonable compromise’ Brexit deal: By early October, the PM had made a formal proposal to the EU setting out his alternative to the Irish backstop. He claimed his plan was “entirely compatible with maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland”, unlike the “bridge to nowhere” backstop.
                    <li> 19 October 2019 - the showdown: Parliament hosted a special session for MPs on Saturday 19 October - less than two weeks before the Halloween Brexit deadline. It was the fifth time Parliament sat on a Saturday for 80 years, with the previous occasions including include the day before the outbreak of the Second World War, the Suez Crisis in 1956 and the Falklands War in 1982, says The Guardian. Johnson was legally obliged by the Benn Act to send a letter to the EU on that date requesting a three-month Brexit extension after Parliament refused to pass his deal.
                    <li> 31 January 2020 – departure day: Having won the majority he so desired in December, Johnson passes his withdrawal agreement, paving the way for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January.
                    <li> 16 October – Johnson backs away: after multiple events, Johnson says the UK should “go for the Australia solution” as he announced that it’s time to “get ready" for the prospect of no-deal Brexit.

                  On the graph, we can see that before the vote on June 23, 2016, the number of citations was very limited. The number started to increase until July 13, 2016, the day Theresa May became PM, before dropping again and entering a stationary phase. We anticipated seeing more dramatic variations in the number of quotes tying in with these specific dates, though we must keep in mind that the plot only considers data from Quotebank, which may not represent what is actually shared by all media outlets.

                It s suprising that most of views are neg when the brexit was still voted yes but we have to keep in mind it doesnt reflect the opinion

This is not surprising knowing that she was in the midst of this whole Brexit issue and did all her companionship around it. Next is the current Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, of the Conservative Party, who was also involved in the Brexit issue. In 19th spot we find Donald Trump , who was the President of the USA for most of the time studied.

This difference must be even more drastic for the rest of the speakers. We can see that most of the quotes from Theresa May contain a positive sentiment towards the Brexit. While this may seem surprising, we see that Boris Johnson's quotes are mostly negative, but keep in mind that the sentiment analysis retained the overall sentiment of the quote, not the opinion on the Brexit.</p>

Then we find the European countries and some common wealth countries. One has also to note that the quotations have been extracted mostly from western media, thus the predominance of these regions in the statistics.</p>

Trade unionist, a left wing party mainly from the UK and Ireland, are strongly negative towards Brexit. For journalists, this is still the case, but the split is fairly even between the three emotions. We can also see that most of the people represented coming from the UK are politicians, while in other countries like the US, there are mostly journalists. In addition to journalists and politicians, we can observe that soccer players are very active. This may be due to the fact that the selected data filters out England words for example and that data may contain information about soccer.</p>
